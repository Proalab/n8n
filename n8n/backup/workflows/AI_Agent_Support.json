For business needs or larger routes, we offer affordable subscriptions designed to cover essential costs like map providers, servers, and ongoing app enhancements.\nHere’s a quick comparison of subscription plans:\n- Route4Me: $9.99/month (10 stops free, 7-day history)\n- RoadWarrior: $14.99/month (8 stops free)\n- Circuit: $19.99/month (10 stops free)\n- Zeo: $16.99/month (12 stops free)\n- Upper: $19.99/month (no free optimization)\n- MyWay: $9.99/month (15 stops free).\nSubscriptions cost roughly the same as 1–2 gallons (3-8 liters) of gas, and with optimized routes, you can save up to 30% on fuel alone—making the subscription easily pay for itself!\nExciting news: a new web interface for business users is launching in June, featuring streamlined billing and license management. Stay tuned!\n\n—\n\nHi there! Currently, MyWay supports routes with up to 200 stops per route and unlimited routes. For routes over 200 stops, optimization quality can drop because it takes more processing power to keep routes efficient. Many apps that allow more stops use shortcuts like “as-the-crow-flies” mapping, which isn’t as accurate.\nWe’re working on increasing the cap to 300 stops and eventually 500, but we’re focused on doing it right to keep the quality of optimizations high. Thanks for your patience!\n\n—\n\nHi! MyWay business version is currently in closed beta. For now, you can't share one subscription with multiple users, and each team member will need their own subscription through the App Store or Google Play. You can still share routes easily with teammates: https://help.mywayroute.com/guides/export-your-route-and-share-it-with-others\nGood news: a new web interface for business users will launch in June. It will feature streamlined billing, live tracking, cross-device sync, dispatcher view, and simplified billing for teams. Stay tuned!\n\n—\n\nHi! When you use MyWay, your routes and data are stored on your device to keep them private. This means there’s no easy way to transfer data between devices and there is no cross-device sync. You can still share routes via links: https://help.mywayroute.com/guides/export-your-route-and-share-it-with-others\nIn June 2025, we’ll roll out a web interface with cross-device sync and automatic backups, making it even easier to manage your routes between devices while keeping your data secure.\n\n—\n\nHi!

We’re sorry to hear you weren’t happy with the app. Could you share more details about what didn’t meet your expectations? We’d love to improve!\n\n—\n\nHi! If the app is having trouble finding addresses or returns incorrect ones, ensure it has location access and try adding more details to your search. You can also switch the geocoding provider, as different providers work better in various areas. Go to Preferences (top-right corner on the main screen) > Maps & Geocoding > Geocoding Provider to make the change. This should help!\nP.S. If you still have issues, please share a specific address and geocoding provider you use, and our team will check it out. \n\n—\n\nHi, we experienced a temporary server outage that triggered an unexpected error (52000), causing the app to malfunction and fail to build routes.
